                    in my results, as I have noticed fluctuations in my performance. Instead of 
                    relying solely on motivation, which can be temporary and unreliable, I need to 
                    a strong sense of self-discipline to ensure steady progress over time. Motiva
                    tion may give me an initial push, but discipline is what will keep me moving 
                    forward even when I don't feel inspired. I acknowledge that some of my curren
                    t results are not yet where I want them to be, and I recognize the importance 
                    of making a consistent effort to improve. By the next term, I aim to set clea
                    rer goals, develop better study and practice habits, and stay committed to pu
                    shing myself beyond my current limits to achieve better outcomes.
